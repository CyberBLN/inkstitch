This feature will be part of an upcoming Ink/Stitch release. It is not yet integrated in Ink/Stitch v2.1.2
{: .notice--info }

Cutwork in machine embroidery describes an technique, where you use specific needles to cut holes into the fabric. These needles come mostly in a set of four, while each needle is only capable to cut a specific angle range. Therefore it is necessary to split the element that you want to cut into the angle sections of your needles.

Ink/Stitch comes with a tool that will help you to split your elements according to the needle angles.

* Open `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Cutwork segmentation`
  ![Cutwork segmentation window](/assets/images/docs/en/cutwork-segmentation.png)
* Set the angles and colors as you need them for your specific needle kit

Here is a small list of common needle setups.

Note, that sometimes it would make sense to not fully cut the hole to prevent that the machine will pull in small pieces of fabric.
