## Stitch Plan Preview

Run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Visualize and Export > Stitch Plan Preview...`.
Instead of apllying the stitch plan, you can also use the `Live preview` option. Then you don't need to undo your changes afterwards.

You have the following display options:
* **Move stitch plan beside the canvas** Displays the preview on the right side of the canvas. If not enabled, the stitch plan will be placed on top of your design. In that case you may want to update your design visibility to eather hidden or lower opacity.
* **Display layer visibility** defines the visibility of the original design layer.
  * **unchanged** leave it as is
  * **hidden** hide the original design
  * **lower opacity** display original design with lower opacity
* **Needle points** displays needle points if enabled
